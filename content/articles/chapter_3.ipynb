    "## Introduction and objectives\n",
    "In this chapter we design and implement our first real working C++ code. Our goal is to model  a European option by a C++ class. We know that a class has a member data and member functions in general and in this case we model the following option attributes:\n",
    "* Strike price\n",
    "* Volatility\n",
    "* Risk-free interest rate\n",
    "* Expiry date\n",
    "as member data. Furthermore, we are interested in designing call and put options as well as modelling some of their interesting properties, namely option price and option sensitivities, for example:\n",
    "* Option delta\n",
    "* Option gamma\n",
    "* Other option sensitivities (for more options, see Haug, 1998)\n",
    "We set up basic infraestructure by implementing the software in two files. First, we define the `EuropeanOption` class in a so-called *header file*. This means that we declare the option's member data and member functions in this file. It can be seen as a specification of the class. Second, we implement the functions that were declared in the header file and this is done in a so-called *code file*. Together, these two files describe the class. It is possible to use just one file but we prefer using two files because the code is easier to maintain in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a well-known example, in this case a European Option. We implement it in C++ and in this way the reader will become familiar with C++ syntax and the object-oriented way of thinking as soon as possible. In later chapters we shall add more functionality to this class. This is the best way to learn, namely step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:\n",
    "* Creating my first C++ class: separating class design issues from class implementation.\n",
    "* Member data and member functions in C++; the different categories of member functions.\n",
    "* Determining accessibility levels in a class.\n",
    "* Using the `EuropeanOption` class in test programs and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having studied this chapter you will have gained a good understanding of a basic C++ class. Having understood the topics in this chapter we then proceed to more advanced functionality in chapter four. In particular, we discuss a number of C++ features in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ class that we introduce in this chapter implements the closed form solution for the Black-Scholes equation and it will be used in later chapters to test the accuracy of approximate methods such as the binomial method and finite difference schemes."

    "## Class `==` member data `+` member functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, programming any class involves -- *grosso modo* -- determining its member functions and member data. We are working in Financial Engineering and in order to reduce the scope here we examine European options.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ is an example of a *class-based object-oriented language*. A class is a description of a group of related attributes and operations. In C++ we use the synonyms *member data* for attributes and member functions** for operations. The member data and member functions are closely related. This feature is called *encapsulation*. In short, the class's functions know which attributes to use. Let us take an example of a class implementing European options for stocks. The defining parameters for the European option will be designed in C++ as the following member data:\n",
    "* The risk-free interest rate: $r$.\n",
    "* The volatility of the relative price change: $\\sigma$.\n",
    "* The strike price: $K$.\n",
    "* The time to expiration (in years): $T$.\n",
    "* The stock price: $S$ (or $U$ depending on the underlying).\n",
    "* The cost-of-carry: $b$.\n",
    "The cost-of-carry for the Black-Scholes model has the same value as $r$ but will have different values depending on the type of underlying asset (for example, $b=0$ for a future option), see Haug, 1998). We must define the data types of the member data. In this case we usually design them as `double` precision number although C++ allows us to design classes with so-called *generic data types*. This means that the member data can be customized with different *specific data types* depending on the current requirements. Having defined the member data we now must decide what to do with the data. To this end, we introduce the concept of *object* (or *instance* of a class). A class is abstract in the sense that is member data have not been instantiated (or *instance* of a class). A class is abstract in the sense that is member data have not been instantiated (they are just abstract descriptions of data) while an object is tangible and all its member data have been initialised. For example, the following assignments describe a European option on an index (Haug, 1998, p. 15):\n",
    "* Underlying value (stock price index) $U=500$.\n",
    "* Volatility $\\sigma = 0.15$.\n",
    "* Strike Price $K=490$.\n",
    "* Time to expiry $T=0.25$ ($3$ months).\n",
    "* Risk-free interest rate $r=0.08$.\n",
    "* Cost-of-carry $b=0.03$.\n",
    "Having discussed member data we now describe the functionality of classes and objects. In general, a class has member functions that model the lifecycle of an object. The main categories in general are:\n",
    "* Member functions (*constructors*) for creation of objetcs.\n",
    "* Member functions that modify the member data (*modifiers*).\n",
    "* Member functions that perform calculations on the member data (*selectors*).\n",
    "* A member function (*destructor*) that deletes an object when no longer needed.\n",
    "There are various ways to create an object using constructors. For example, it is possible to create an instance of a European option class by initialising its member data. Two other constructors deserve mention: first, the *default constructor* creates an object with default member data while the *copy constructor* creates an object as a deep copy of some other object. The destructor is the other extreme; it removes the object from memory when the object is no longer needed. We note that the names of constructors and of the destructor are the same as the name of their corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now discuss the member functions that operate on an object after it has been constructed and before it is destructed. Again, we concentrate on the class for European options.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ is based on the *message-passing paradigm*. This means that client code sends a message to an object by calling its member functions. For example, here is a piece of code that calculates the price of the index put option that we introduced earlier (we assume that the member data have been initialised):"

    "## The header file (function prototypes)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the code that is needed for a complete description of a class in C++ is contained in two files: first, the header file (this section) and this contains the formal descriptions of the member data and member functions in the class. Second, the code file contains the body of each declared member function. In other words, each member function declaration in the header file must have a corresponding entry in the code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now discuss the details of the header file. First, there are two regions or parts called *private* and *public*, respectively. Both parts may contain member data and member functions. Members that are declared in the private part are not accessible from outside the class and may only be accessed by members in the class itself while public members may be accessed by any C++ code. In general, all data should be declared in the private part because this tends to change; however, in this chapter we place the data that represents the structure of an option in the public area. This is for convenience only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The public member functions in the options class can be categorised as follows (see the code below):\n",
    "* Constructors: the different ways of creating instances of option class.\n",
    "* Destructors: deleting an object when it is no longer needed (automatically taken care of by the runtime system).\n",
    "* Assignment operator: the ability to assign one object to another object (this is a 'deepy' copy).\n",
    "* 'Core business' functions: these are the functions that calculate the price and the delta for the option, for example.\n",
    "* Other functions: for example, it is possible to switch a call option to a put option (and viceversa). Of course, the price and delta will be different!"

To this end, we can define *private* and *public* member areas:\n",

This is a good application of the object-oriented paradigm: we encapsulate tightly-coupled data representing an option's parameter and we then create member functions that act on that data. Before we go overboad by thinking that everything in sight *must* be a class or object we mention that there are other paradigms that are just as effective and that can be used in conjunction with, or as a competitor to, the object-oriented paradigm. To this end, we show how modular programming techniques can be used in Quantitative Finance by taking some simple examples of interest rate calculations (see Fabozzi 1993; Hull, 2006). The examples are not difficult but we use them because they elaborate on a number of coding issues that will be needed in this book.\n",
