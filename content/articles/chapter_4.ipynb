    "# Creating Robust Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter three we coded a simple class in C++ using the syntax that we had introduced in that chapter. Of course, it was not possible (or even diserable) to discuss all possible 'syntax avenues' because doing so would be confusing. In this chapter we wish to create more robust and efficient classes and we realise this goal by using some of the syntax that C++ offers. In particular, we address a number of issues that have to do with data and object security, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue 1: Ensuring that objects and their data are created in a safe way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue 2: Accesing and using objects in a safe way; avoiding side-effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue 3: Working with object references rather than copies of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue 4: Optimization: static objects and static member data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a lot of territory to cover and the results in this chapter will be used again and again throughout this book. Thus, this chapter is a vital link to future chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important topics are:\n",
    "* Passing parameters to functions by value or by reference.\n",
    "* Function overloading: ability to define several functions having the same name.\n",
    "* More on constructors.\n",
    "* Not all functions need be member functions: non-member functions.\n",
    "* The `const` keyword and its consequences for C++ applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having understood these topics and having implemented them in simple classes the reader will have reached a level of expertise approaching yellow belt. We discuss these topics not only because they are supported in C++ but because they help us become good C++ developers. They also promote the reliability and efficiency of our code."
