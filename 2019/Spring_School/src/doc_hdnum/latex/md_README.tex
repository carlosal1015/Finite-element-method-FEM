As a special exception, you may use the H\+D\+N\+UM source files as part of a software library or application without restriction. Specifically, if other files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions from one or more of the H\+D\+N\+UM source files, or you compile one or more of the H\+D\+N\+UM source files and link them with other files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the G\+NU General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the G\+NU General Public License. \end{quote}

There is no installation. Just include the header file {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{hdnum_8hh_source}{hdnum.\+hh}}} and that is it.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Building the documentation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
In the {\ttfamily hdnum} top-\/level directory just run {\ttfamily doxygen}. This will build the Doxygen documentation into the directory {\ttfamily doc/html} or {\ttfamily doc/latex}, respectively.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{History}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
